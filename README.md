### Customer-Churn-Dashboard

In the BI project focused on customer churn analysis, the journey began with importing the dataset and ensuring its cleanliness. Essential DAX measures and calculated columns were introduced to bolster the analytical capabilities. Establishing relationships between diverse tables, including active customer data, bank churn, credit card usage, customer information, exit patterns, and demographic aspects like gender and geography, was the next step.

The resultant dashboard offers insightful KPI cards representing various customer categories: total customers, active customers, credit card holders, non-credit card holders, exit customers, and retained customers. User-friendly filters enable data exploration based on year, month name, geography, and customer status categories (active, exit). A bar chart visually captures the total customers across different years and active categories, while a line chart illustrates exit customers' trends in the previous month, segmented by year and month name.

The dashboard further leverages a chart to showcase exit customer patterns based on credit card type and a bar chart depicting exit customers' distribution by category. This project empowers a comprehensive understanding of customer behaviors, helping identify trends and actionable insights for improved retention strategies and decision-making within the realm of customer analysis.

### Objective

>Detect and understand the key patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, focusing on variables such as credit score, geography, age, tenure, balance, and product usage.

>Provide insights into customer segmentation based on various criteria like gender, geography, credit card ownership, and active/inactive membership. This will help in targeting specific customer groups for retention strategies.

>Develop predictive models that leverage the identified variables to predict customer churn. These models can be used to assess the likelihood of churn for individual customers, enabling proactive retention efforts.

>Analyze the performance of credit card holders versus non-holders, as well as active versus inactive members. Determine if having a credit card or being an active member influences churn rates.

>Examine the historical trends of churn over time, considering factors like the customer's date of joining (DOJ) and other variables. This analysis can help in understanding how churn rates have evolved and whether any specific periods exhibit higher churn
